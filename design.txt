'Level improving from ucs to ucs -d
'This level is designed to have many deadlocks and unsolvable states if pushed wrong.
'Thus, with deadlock detection, UCS can ignore a lot of search since a deadlock won't lead to a solution

'Level improving from ucs -d to f -d
'This level is designed to have several different very long paths with a single box. With action compression, it can find the 
'shortest path and have a "singular" action to push the box. UCS on the otherhand, has to tirelessly iterate through individual actions
' to find the path rather than doing it in one swoop.

'Level improving from f -d to fa -d
'The addition of the heurstic heavily assists in this problem since the boxes are so close to the goals
'The solver can immediately know what box pushes will move them closer to the goal rather than exploring all
'the empty space.
